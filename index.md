The one in the picture is me! I am Tomás Ahumada and I am a ~~first~~  ~~second~~ raising third year Astronomy PhD student at the University of Maryland (UMD). I am a Chilean astronomer searching for optical counterparts of short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. I am working with Dr. Leo Singer from NASA using the Zwicky Transient Facility to cover large portions of the sky and maxime the probability to find a transients in the northern nightsky. 

I cursed my undergraduate studies at the P. Universidad Católica de Chile and majored in Astronomy. While there I worked with both Prof. Felipe Barrientos and Prof. Karim Pichara on using machine learning algorithms to find quasars in the ATLAS survey. 

During the southern hemisphere summer, I was part of the Cerro Tololo (CTIO) Reaserch Experience for Undergraduates and work with Dr. Bryan Miller (from Gemini observatory) on identifying globular clasters of the shell-elliptical galaxy NGC3923. After my graduation I interned at Gemini and further analyze the morphology of the galaxy.
