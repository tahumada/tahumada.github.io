The one in the picture is me! I am Tomás Ahumada and I am a ~~first~~  ~~second~~ ~~thirdo~~  fourth year Astronomy PhD student at the University of Maryland (UMD). I am a Chilean astronomer searching for optical counterparts of short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. I am working with Dr. Leo Singer from NASA using the Zwicky Transient Facility to cover large portions of the sky and maximize the probability to find transients in the northern nightsky. 

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the P. Universidad Católica de Chile where I majored in Astronomy. While there, I worked with both Prof. Felipe Barrientos and Prof. Karim Pichara on using machine learning algorithms to find quasars in the ATLAS survey. 

During the southern hemisphere summer in 2016, I was part of the Cerro Tololo (CTIO) Reaserch Experience for Undergraduates and worked with Dr. Bryan Miller (from Gemini Observatory) on identifying globular clasters of the shell-elliptical galaxy NGC3923. After my graduation I interned at Gemini and further analyzed the morphology of the galaxy.
